When writing a pull reguest and making changes we strongly recommend to:
+ make sure your changes work without any easily noticeable issues or bugs
+ discuss your idea on the discord before working on any changes

 Standarts of adding new content:
+ no 18+ content
+ both fantasy and sci-fi content is allowed
+ no storyline, only possible lore clues and "quasi-lore" (this doesnt mean no boss fights)
+ fun above realism
+ references to media you like are welcome
