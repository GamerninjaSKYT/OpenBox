-How to add stuff-

Adding an item:
-create a new inventory_item resource
-fill out the properties (remember to assign it a unique id)
-capitalize the first letter of every word in the name of the item
-add it to the itemlist in the ItemManager and make sure its place in the list matches its id

Adding a block:
-clone an existing block packedscene
-fill out the properties (remember to assign it a unique id and reset any item_instances such as the drop property or else editing it will affect the block you cloned)
